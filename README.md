# Blender Addon for Wavefront OBJ with Vertex Color

Blender Addon to import/export Wavefront OBJ with Vertex Color. This addon is based on [the official blender addon](https://github.com/blender/blender-addons).

So far the testing is not really sufficient. If you have any troubles importing / exporting your .obj data, please report an issue.
